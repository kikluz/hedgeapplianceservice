    <q>David saved the day! Our fridge slowly started loosing its cool. I messaged him to find out if it was fixable or not and he responded quickly, booked our appointment after hours to accommodate our work schedules and made the repair in no time. Affordable, friendly service by a local, knowledgeable expert! I highly recommend Hedge Appliance!</q>
